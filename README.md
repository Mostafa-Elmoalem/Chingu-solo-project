# 🍱 Omnifood – Chingu Solo Project

## 🚀 Project Story

This project was built as part of my **Chingu Solo Project**, where I designed and developed a fully responsive, modern landing page for a fictional AI-powered food delivery service — **Omnifood**.

The main goal was to sharpen my **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** skills by creating a real-world, component-based web project from scratch — without any frameworks — and applying clean code principles and responsive design.

## 🧠 The Idea Behind Omnifood

Omnifood is a technology-first company with a mission to help busy people **eat healthy every day** — without the hassle of shopping, cooking, or planning.

Using AI, Omnifood creates **100% personalized weekly meal plans** based on user preferences, dietary needs, and goals. It then coordinates with local chefs and restaurant partners to prepare and deliver each meal — on time, every day.

The service operates as a **subscription-based model**, offering both single and double meal plans, with the flexibility to pause or cancel anytime.
